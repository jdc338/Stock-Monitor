# Stock-Monitor

Overview
This application monitors the prices for the following stocks: Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Nike and sends out tailored alerts.

If the price of a stock falls by more than Â£0.25, this will immediately trigger a notification to be sent out, allowing the purchase of more stock. If the stock price falls below the 7 day average, this will also trigger an alert. For our notifications, we have used automation website IFTTT: https://ifttt.com/.
